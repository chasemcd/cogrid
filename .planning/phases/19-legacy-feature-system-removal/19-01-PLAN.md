<objective>
Delete the old OOP feature system entirely and remove build_feature_fn from the GridObject component classmethod convention, leaving a single code path for features via ArrayFeature subclasses + autowire composition.

Purpose: Eliminate dead code paths left over from the pre-v1.3 feature system. The ArrayFeature + autowire system is now the sole feature composition path (wired in Phase 18), so the old OOP Feature/FeatureSpace classes, the monolithic build_overcooked_feature_fn, and the build_feature_fn GridObject classmethod convention are all dead weight.

Output: A codebase with exactly one feature system -- ArrayFeature subclasses composed by autowire.

    **Delete these 4 files entirely** (git rm):
    - `cogrid/feature_space/feature.py` -- old OOP Feature base class
    - `cogrid/feature_space/feature_space.py` -- old FeatureSpace registry + make_feature_generator
    - `cogrid/feature_space/features.py` -- old OOP feature implementations (FullMapImage, FoVImage, AgentDir, etc.)
    - `cogrid/envs/overcooked/overcooked_features.py` -- old OOP Overcooked feature implementations (OvercookedCollectedFeatures, LayoutID, ClosestObj, etc.)

    **Edit `cogrid/feature_space/__init__.py`:**
    - Remove both existing import lines (`from cogrid.feature_space import feature_space` and `from cogrid.feature_space import features`)
    - Replace with a single line: `from cogrid.feature_space import array_features  # noqa: F401`
    - This is needed because `cogrid/core/autowire.py` does `import cogrid.feature_space.array_features` to trigger registration, and having the __init__ expose it is cleaner.

    **Edit `cogrid/feature_space/array_features.py`:**
    - Remove the `compose_features()` function (lines ~245-261). It is only used by the legacy `build_feature_fn()`.
    - Remove the `build_feature_fn()` function (lines ~264-328). This is the legacy monolithic feature builder. The new path is `compose_feature_fns()` in `cogrid/core/array_features.py` via autowire.
    - KEEP: all bare feature functions (`agent_pos_feature`, `agent_dir_feature`, `full_map_encoding_feature`, `can_move_direction_feature`, `inventory_feature`), all 4 ArrayFeature subclasses (`AgentDir`, `AgentPosition`, `CanMoveDirection`, `Inventory`), and `get_all_agent_obs()`.
    - Update the module docstring to remove references to `build_feature_fn()` (lines 8-10 reference "Feature composition ... is resolved at init time via build_feature_fn()").

    **Edit `cogrid/core/grid_object.py`:**
    - Remove `"build_feature_fn"` from the `_COMPONENT_METHODS` frozenset (line 45).

    **Edit `cogrid/core/component_registry.py`:**
    - Remove `"build_feature_fn": []` from `_EXPECTED_SIGNATURES` dict (line 106).
    - Remove the `has_feature_fn` property from `ComponentMetadata` (lines 56-57).

    **Edit `cogrid/core/autowire.py` in `build_scope_config_from_components()`:**
    - Remove the entire `feature_fn_builder` composition block (lines 223-233): the `feature_fn_builder = None`, the `feat_builders` list comprehension using `has_feature_fn`, the single-builder and multi-builder branches.
    - Remove `"feature_fn_builder": feature_fn_builder` from the return dict (line 247).

    **Edit `cogrid/envs/overcooked/overcooked_grid_objects.py`:**
    - Remove the `build_feature_fn` classmethod from the `Pot` class (lines 279-282). This is the classmethod that returned `build_overcooked_feature_fn`.

    **Edit `cogrid/envs/overcooked/overcooked_array_features.py`:**
    - Remove the entire `build_overcooked_feature_fn()` function (starts around line 486, ends around line 642). This is the monolithic feature builder that Phase 18 replaced with autowire composition. It spans from `def build_overcooked_feature_fn(` through `return feature_fn`.
    - KEEP everything else: all bare feature functions, all ArrayFeature subclasses, the `register_feature_order` / `register_layout_indices` calls at the bottom.
    - Remove the import of `build_overcooked_feature_fn` from any `__all__` or module-level exports if present.

    **Edit `cogrid/envs/overcooked/__init__.py`:**
    - Remove the line `from cogrid.envs.overcooked import overcooked_features` (line 1). The remaining 3 imports (overcooked_grid_objects, array_rewards, overcooked_array_features) stay.

    **Edit `cogrid/cogrid_env.py`:**
    - Remove `from cogrid.feature_space import feature_space` import (line 23).
    - Remove the entire `features` parsing block and `self.feature_spaces` / `self.observation_spaces` construction (lines 173-197). These use the old FeatureSpace class which is being deleted.
    - Remove the `get_obs()` method (lines 920-929) that delegates to `self.feature_spaces`.
    - IMPORTANT: The vectorized observation path (`self._feature_fn`, built in `reset()` via `build_feature_config_from_components`) is the sole observation path now and must NOT be touched. Check whether `self.observation_spaces` is used elsewhere in the file; if so, it may need to be rebuilt from `feature_config["obs_dim"]` in `reset()`. Verify by grepping for `observation_space` in the file.

    **Edit `docs/content/cogrid_env.rst`:**
    - Remove the `.. automodule:: cogrid.feature_space.feature` directive (line 29).

  <done>
    The 4 old OOP feature files are deleted. build_feature_fn is removed from _COMPONENT_METHODS, _EXPECTED_SIGNATURES, and ComponentMetadata. feature_fn_builder is removed from scope_config. Pot.build_feature_fn and build_overcooked_feature_fn are removed. All imports updated.

    **Edit `cogrid/tests/test_step_pipeline.py`:**
    - Three locations import `from cogrid.feature_space.array_features import build_feature_fn` (lines 31, 205, 305). Replace these with the autowire path: `from cogrid.core.autowire import build_feature_config_from_components`.
    - At each call site, replace `build_feature_fn(feature_names, scope="overcooked")` with:
      ```python
      feature_config = build_feature_config_from_components("overcooked", n_agents=n_agents)
      feature_fn = feature_config["feature_fn"]
      ```
      where `n_agents` is available in the test context (it comes from `array_state["n_agents"]`).
    - Remove the `feature_names` list at each site since it is no longer needed (the autowire discovers features from the registry).

    **Edit `cogrid/tests/test_overcooked_array_features.py`:**
    - Remove `test_autowire_provides_feature_fn_builder` (lines 277-289). This test validated that Pot.build_feature_fn appeared in scope_config, which is being deleted.
    - Remove `test_generic_scope_has_no_feature_fn_builder` (lines 292-297). Same reason.

    **Edit `cogrid/tests/test_autowire.py`:**
    - Remove `"feature_fn_builder"` from the `required_keys` set (line 55). The scope_config no longer includes this key.

    **Edit `cogrid/test_overcooked_env.py`:**
    - Remove the 3 imports of old feature modules (lines 11-13):
      ```python
      from cogrid.feature_space import feature
      from cogrid.feature_space import features
      from cogrid.feature_space import feature_space
      ```
    - Remove `from cogrid.envs.overcooked import overcooked_features` (line 14).
    - Check whether the `feature_space.register_feature(...)` call at line 152 exists and remove it if so (it registers an old OOP feature using the deleted registry).
    - Scan the rest of the file for any remaining references to `feature_space`, `features`, or `feature.Feature` and remove/update them. The old test file uses the OOP feature system which no longer exists; any tests that call `feature.generate()` or `FeatureSpace.generate_features()` will need to be removed or rewritten to use the new system. Assess what tests exist and whether they test behavior already covered by the array feature tests in `cogrid/tests/test_array_features.py` and `cogrid/tests/test_overcooked_array_features.py`. If so, just remove the dead code. If any tests are unique and valuable, rewrite them using the autowire path.

    **Final verification:**
    Run the full test suite: `python -m pytest cogrid/tests/ -x -v` to confirm all tests pass.
    Also run: `python -m pytest cogrid/test_overcooked_env.py -x -v` (this file is outside cogrid/tests/).
    If any test failures arise from the removed imports/code, fix them.
