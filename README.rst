CoGrid is a library that extends Minigrid to support multi-agent environments. 
It is built on top of the Minigrid library, which is a minimalistic gridworld environment for OpenAI Gym. 
CoGrid is designed to support multi-agent reinforcement learning research, 
and it provides a simple API for creating multi-agent gridworld environments.

CoGrid utilizes the PettingZoo API to standardize the multi-agent environment interface.

Example Project usage
---------------------

CoGrid is meant to provide a simple, customizable API for creating multi-agent gridworld environments. It s
You can build and view this documentation project locally - we recommend that you activate `a local Python virtual environment first <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment>`_:

.. code-block:: console

    # Install required Python dependencies (Sphinx etc.)
    pip install -r docs/requirements.txt

    # Enter the Sphinx project
    cd docs/
    
    # Run the raw sphinx-build command
    sphinx-build -M html . _build/


You can also build the documentation locally with ``make``:

.. code-block:: console

    # Enter the Sphinx project
    cd docs/
    
    # Build with make
    make html
    
    # Open with your preferred browser, pointing it to the documentation index page
    firefox _build/html/index.html


Using the example in your own project
-------------------------------------

If you are new to Read the Docs, you may want to refer to the `Read the Docs User documentation <https://docs.readthedocs.io/>`_.

If you are copying this code in order to get started with your documentation, you need to:

#. place your ``docs/`` folder alongside your Python project. If you are starting a new project, you can adapt the `pyproject.toml` example configuration.
#. use your existing project repository or create a new repository on Github, GitLab, Bitbucket or another host supported by Read the Docs
#. copy ``.readthedocs.yaml`` and the ``docs/`` folder into your project.
#. customize all the files, replacing example contents.
#. add your own Python project, replacing the ``pyproject.toml`` configuration and ``lumache.py`` module.
#. rebuild the documenation locally to see that it works.
#. *finally*, register your project on Read the Docs, see `Importing Your Documentation <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/import-guide.html>`_.


Read the Docs tutorial
----------------------

To get started with Read the Docs, you may also refer to the `Read the Docs tutorial <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/>`__.
It provides a full walk-through of building an example project similar to the one in this repository.
